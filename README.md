### Tips, Troubleshooting, Known Issues
***
> [!IMPORTANT]
>* **Installation Issues**: Some antivirus software such as McAfee Antivirus software is known to interfere with the installation process of Intel® AI Assistant Builder on Windows systems. If you encounter installation problems and have antivirus installed, please stop the real-time scanning feature and then reinstall Intel® AI Assistant Builder. Once the installation is done and the models are loaded, you can re-enable it. Users might experience performance impacts when antivirus real-time scanning is running.

> [!WARNING]
>* **Model Download Errors**: This issue could be due to a few reasons: 
>    - **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy for Enterprise Environments**: If you are an enterprise user and your organization uses an HTTP or HTTPS proxy, you need to configure it on your AI PC to enable the Intel® AI Assistant Builder to download LLMs, RAG, and other necessary components. Please consult your organization’s IT department to determine which proxy server(s) are in use and how to configure them up on your device.
>    - **Model Download Endpoint**: Check your model download endpoint and consider selecting a different download server.
>      - **For users in the PRC**, ***Model Scope*** is recommended.
>      - **For users in other regions**, please choose the ***Hugging Face***.
>* **Export Config Issues**: For configurations involving a large set of documents, only a partial set of text chunks is currently exported. Support for exporting a full set is currently under development.
>* **NPU model limitation**: The NPU model is supported only on ***Lunar Lake*** systems.

> [!CAUTION]
>* **Initial load time / Unresponsive**: When the AI assistant is started, the assistant service and models must be initialized before the assistant can be used. During this time, the chat text entry field will be disabled, and a status message at the bottom of the window will indicate what is happening. When the AI assistant is ready, the status bar at the bottom of the window will be removed and the chat text entry will be enabled.
> ![A close-up of a red and grey rectangle AI-generated content may be incorrect.](media/notification_border.png)
>* **Model Loading Errors**: If a “model loading error” occurs, please make sure to update the GPU and NPU drivers to the latest version. The NPU model requires NPU Driver **32.0.100.3714 at a minimum**.
>* **Backend Not Ready**: When running the Intel® AI Assistant Builder for the first time a "backend not ready" condition may occur, especially when there is a slow network connection.  Please re-start the application and if possible move to a location which has a better network connection.
>* **Upgrade Errors**: If you are upgrading from ```v1.1.0``` to ```v1.2.0```, the installer might have issues removing all your selected local files. If you wish to remove everything, we recommend fully uninstalling the application using Window's built-in _Add or Remove Programs_, and then installing ```v1.2.0```.
>* **Model Conversion Error**: The model conversion tool within the Intel® AI Assistant Builder supports models compatible with the **Intel® OpenVINO** platform. Not all models are supported. <br> 
Some models on Hugging Face require user consent before they can be downloaded. Our application cannot proceed with the download until you consent to the Hugging Face model terms.
>* **Query Tabular Data Issue**: Query Tabular Data will fail to process XLSX files having `time` format. A fix for this will be included in the next release.
>* **Conversation History - Reset to Defaults Issue**: Although the `Reset to Defaults` button sets the `Conversation History` to 0, the conversation history is still utilized in the context. To resolve this issue, please manually adjust the value using the slider.
>* **Intermittent Qwen2 and Qwen2.5 Models Issue**: The Qwen2 and Qwen2.5 models have a known intermittent issue where they occasionally generate unwanted responses with exclamation marks. This behavior is not consistently reproducible, but retrying the query typically resolves the problem.
>* **White Title Bar Issue:** When upgrading from an older version to v1.2.0, you might see a white title bar at the top.  Go to *Settings > Appearance* and click the "Reset" button to correct this. If you want to keep your existing style, make sure to export the configuration (*Settings > Export/Import Configuration > Export*) before resetting the appearance.
> ![Model Tools](media/white_title_bar.png)

> [!TIP]
>* **Multiple Assistants Support**: Users can use our Import and Export functions to try out multiple assistant profiles on the same local AI PC.

- Model Conversion to OpenVINO Format
The model conversion utility enables the conversion of most 'Text Generation' models to the OpenVINO format for immediate use in the assistant or wherever you plan to use a given model. You can convert models directly from Hugging Face or from a local folder. Optimized performance, compatibility, and efficiency of model execution are just a few benefits of this new utility. Please note that the model conversion utility does not work with all models, and it is important to verify the accuracy of any converted model.

The new "Import and Export Assistant" feature simplifies the process of transferring data and configurations between computers and when conducting upgrades or re-installations. The option to export a "Built" assistant and allow another user to import it facilitates collaboration and sharing.

- New HR Special Query called Resume Match
The new HR assistant feature allows unlimited resume uploads in one session, intelligently scores resumes against job descriptions, extracts key details from top candidates using RAG, and facilitates continuous conversational analysis of documents.

- Update to Query Tabular Data
The Query Tabular Data feature now shows the SQL query used to generate the response, allowing users to verify, correct if necessary, and rerun the adjusted query.

- New Collect Metrics Parameter
The new Collect Metrics parameter, when enabled by the user, gathers performance metrics related to file ingestion and response generation, providing valuable insights.

##### Version 1.0
